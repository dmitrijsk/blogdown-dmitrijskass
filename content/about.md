Hi! I'm Dmitrijs Kass, lecturer at [Latvian University](https://www.lu.lv/en/studies/faculties/faculty-of-physics-mathematics-and-optometry/) and [Riga Business School](http://www.rbs.lv/bachelor). I enjoy teaching **data analysis and visualization with R** as much as applying it in practice at [Creamfinance](https://www.creamfinance.com/) in the role of a Data science team leader. Finding ways to explain unobvious things in an intuitive manner and seeing eyes lighting up in the audience is what motivates me. 

This blog is intended to serve few purposes:

* Share the work I enjoy doing, such as **data viz and telling stories with data**.
* Share my approach to understanding various elements of **data science** by deconstructing them into simple components and using examples to aid an intuitive understanding. 
* Invite **feedback** from the community about my work so that I may improve in fulfilling the first two purposes.
