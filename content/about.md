Hi! I'm Dmitrijs, currently the "Machine Learning and Statistics" master's student at Uppsala University in Sweden. More information is available in [my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dmitrijs-kass-prm/).

I enjoy exploring concepts in data science and visualization to gain an intuitive understanding of them. Properly coded and documented stories get to this blog and serve as a cheat-sheet for my future self. Hopefully, you will find valuable insights for yourself here as well.

Thanks for visiting! \
Dmitrijs Kass
