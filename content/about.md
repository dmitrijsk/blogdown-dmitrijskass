Hi! I'm Dmitrijs Kass, lecturer at [Latvian University](https://www.lu.lv/en/studies/faculties/faculty-of-physics-mathematics-and-optometry/) and [Riga Business School](http://www.rbs.lv/bachelor). I enjoy teaching **data analysis and visualization with R** as much as applying it in practice at [Creamfinance](https://www.creamfinance.com/) in the role of a Data science team leader.

This blog is intended to serve few purposes:

* Share the work I enjoy doing, such as **data viz and telling stories with data**.
* Share my approach to understanding various elements of **data science**. 
* Invite **feedback** from the community about my work so that I may improve in fulfilling the first two points.
