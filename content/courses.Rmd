**15-17, April and 20-22, May  
Riga, Latvia**

Ability to extract value from business data is crucial in any competitive environment. However, the variety, volume and velocity at which data is being generated in 2020 may limit or paralyze these attempts. In 3 days, learn to employ R programming language, RStudio, statistics and the elements of machine learning to automate data analysis and arrive at data-driven decision that benefit your business.

[You will learn:]{#learning_outcomes}

* How to avoid being fooled by randomness.
* How to conduct and analyse online controlled experiments (also known as [A/B testing](https://hbr.org/2017/09/the-surprising-power-of-online-experiments)) that allow establishing a causal relationship.
* How to automate data gathering from online sources about your competitor products.
* How to automate complex analysis from data import to generation of visually compelling PDF and HTML reports that contain code, results and your narrative.
* How to use clustering for segmenting products into groups that share similar characteristics and simplify the selection process for your customers.
* How to optimize budget spending by predicting customer behaviour.
* How to visualize large volumes of data and explore it with simple yet powerful statistical techniques.
* How to optimize investment decisions using diversification.

This 3-day in-person course is guided by [Dmitrijs Kass](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dmitrijs-kass-prm/), head of data science at Creamfinance with years of teaching experience in both business and academia. The course is practice-heavy and aimed at data analysts, risk analysts, data scientists and other professionals using high volumes of data to arrive at useful conclusions.

### Instructor{#instructor}

My name is Dmitrijs Kass, I am the data science team leader at Creamfinance, a company with data-driven decisions at the core of its values. I am passionate about data science, enjoy sharing my practical experience and explaining complex concepts in simple ways that aid understanding and long-term retention of ideas. Therefore, I am a regular instructor for data analysis with R programming language at the Physics, Mathematics and Optometry faculty of Latvian University and, recently, at Riga Business School. I have also battle-tested the course on data analysis and visualization with R on 150+ business representatives and earned [honourable reviews](#testimonials).




### Why R?{#why_r}

R is a free open-source programming language and an environment that, along with Python, has become an industry standard for data science and machine learning. R and RStudio together offer great tools for a broad range of business and academic needs: from exploratory data analysis, reproducible research, statistics, machine learning, automated data processing and web scraping to building interactive reports and web applications.




### Are you a group of 4+?

### Testimonials{#testimonials}

*The course content is regularly updated based on the feedback of participants and may not match the content currently offered.*

"Data Analysis with R was extremely useful for our analytics team to become more efficient in working with data, and generate ever-more impactful business insights using the power of R. The course is a well-balanced combination of key analytics scenarios from data cleaning to statistical modelling and visualization. Above all, Dmitrijs has a natural talent to explain concepts of all levels of complexity to both technical and non-technical audiences."
Nikita Strezhnev, Rimi Baltic.

“Many thanks to Dmitrijs for a perfect course in 3 days. The content is well-thought-through and oriented to results. In 3 days gained clarity on a practical level about what can be done with R – from data processing to visualization. Recommend.”
Sandijs Liepiņš, SIA Mintos.

“Very self-organized and patient instructor. Replies to absolutely all questions. Takes into account the interests of the audience.”
Elīna Tilta-Gerika, AAS SEB Life Insurance.

“This course is valuable both for those who would like to learn about the opportunities that R offers and for those who have learnt R on their own. Course material is very well structured with a focus on practical applications. After the course you will be able to put new knowledge straight into practice.”
Anonymous.

“Very valuable course and excellent presentation by the instructor.”
Dita, Central Statistical Bureau of Latvia.

“I definitely recommend this course to everyone who is new to R and also those who already use R but are not confident in their knowledge. The content is high quality, well structured and easy to understand! I would apply if there was a continuation of this course, thank you!”
