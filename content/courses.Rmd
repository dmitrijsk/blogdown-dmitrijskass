R is a free open-source programming language and an environment that, along with Python, has became an industry standard for data science and machine learning. R and RStudio together offer great tools for a broad range of business and academic needs: from exploratory data analysis, reproducible research, statistics, machine learning, automated data processing and web scraping to building interactive reports and web applications. 

With practice, the content of the [**Data analysis and visualization with R programming language**](#r_name) course has been proven to lay a solid foundation for applying R at work and continuing learning R independently. 

If you have an interest in other topics, the content may be tailored to your needs - please send a description of topics you would like to cover to dmitrijs.kass@gmail.com.

# Data analysis and visualization with R programming language{#r_name}

This is a 3-day in-person course, where it is my pleasure to guide you from the basics to advanced data analysis and visualization with R. It is suitable for both new R users and those whose experience in R is fragmented. The content is built around essential skills that a working data analyst/scientist should be comfortable with. It was **battle-tested on 150+ participants** and [**earned honourable reviews**](#r_references). Participants of previous courses have commented favourably my passion for clearly explaining new material, sharing practical experience and answering all your questions.

### Practical information

* 3-day in-person course guided by a working data scientist with 3+ years of teaching experience in both academia and industry (see [About](/about/)).
* **Content**: [see below](#r_content).
* **Price**: 350 EUR per person; discounts apply to groups of 3+ members.
* **Place**: for groups - your company's premises in Riga (Latvia) or other location; otherwise [the House of Science in the University of Latvia Academic Centre](https://www.akademiskaiscentrs.lu.lv/ekas/zinatnu-maja/) or another place depending on availability. 
* **Language of instruction**: English, Latvian or Russian.
* **Prerequisites**: prior experience in programming is an advantage, but not required.

<!-- ### Learning outcomes{#r_outcomes} -->

<!-- After a 3-day workshop you will feel comfortable using R and RStudio in doing the following: -->

<!-- * writing predictable and well-structured code, -->
<!-- * data import/export from files and SQL databases, -->
<!-- * tidying data,  -->
<!-- * exploratory data analysis and visualization,  -->
<!-- * manipulating and joining large data sets, -->
<!-- * automating data analysis, -->
<!-- * generating reports with code, results and narrative to communicating the results of your work. -->



### Content{#r_content}

The content covers all steps of a typical data analysis project:

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Typical steps in a data science project as in \"R for Data Science\" by G. Grolemund and H. Wickham", out.width=500, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/data_science_project_steps.png")
```

Modelling is only briefly discussed with several practical examples of statistical tests and machine learning algorithms. The main emphasis is made on how to perform data pre- and post-processing to fit modelling into all other steps covered.
