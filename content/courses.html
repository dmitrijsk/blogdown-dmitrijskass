<p>R is a free open-source programming language and an environment that, along with Python, has become an industry standard for data science and machine learning. R and RStudio together offer great tools for a broad range of business and academic needs: from exploratory data analysis, reproducible research, statistics, machine learning, automated data processing and web scraping to building interactive reports and web applications.</p>
<p>With 3+ year-long practice, the content of the <a href="#r_name"><strong>Data analysis and visualization with R programming language</strong></a> course has been proven to lay a solid foundation for applying R at work and continuing learning R independently.</p>
<p>If you have an interest in other topics, the content may be tailored to your needs - please send a description of topics you would like to cover to <a href="mailto:dmitrijs.kass@gmail.com" class="email">dmitrijs.kass@gmail.com</a>.</p>

<h1>Data analysis and visualization with R programming language</h1>
<p>This is a 3-day in-person course, where it is my pleasure to guide you from the basics to advanced data analysis and visualization with R. It is suitable for both new R users and those whose experience in R is fragmented. The content is built around essential skills that a working data analyst/scientist should be comfortable with. It was <strong>battle-tested on 150+ participants</strong> and <a href="#r_references"><strong>earned honourable reviews</strong></a>. Participants of previous courses have commented favourably my passion for clearly explaining new material, sharing practical experience and answering all your questions.</p>

<h3>Content</h3>
<p>The content covers all steps of a typical data analysis project:</p>

</p>
<p>Modelling is a separate topic it itself. Therefore, it is only briefly discussed with several practical examples of statistical tests and machine learning algorithms. The main emphasis is made on how to perform data pre- and post-processing to plug modelling into all other steps covered.</p>
