<p>Ability to extract value from business data is crucial in any competitive environment. However, the variety, volume and velocity at which data is being generated in 2020 may limit or paralyze these attempts. In 3 days, learn to employ R programming language, RStudio, statistics and the elements of machine learning to automate data analysis and arrive at data-driven decision that benefit your business.</p>
<p><span id="learning_outcomes">You will learn:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>How to avoid being fooled by randomness.</li>
<li>How to conduct and analyse online controlled experiments (also known as <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/09/the-surprising-power-of-online-experiments">A/B testing</a>) that allow establishing a causal relationship.</li>
<li>How to automate data gathering from online sources about your competitor products.</li>
<li>How to automate complex analysis from data import to generation of visually compelling PDF and HTML reports that contain code, results and your narrative.</li>
<li>How to use clustering for segmenting products into groups that share similar characteristics and simplify the selection process for your customers.</li>
<li>How to optimize budget spending by predicting customer behaviour.</li>
<li>How to visualize large volumes of data and explore it with simple yet powerful statistical techniques.</li>
<li>How to optimize investment decisions using diversification.</li>
</ul>
<p>This 3-day in-person course is guided by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dmitrijs-kass-prm/">Dmitrijs Kass</a>, head of data science at Creamfinance with years of teaching experience in both business and academia. The course is practice-heavy and aimed at data analysts, risk analysts, data scientists and other professionals using high volumes of data to arrive at useful conclusions.</p>

<h3>Instructor</h3>
<p>My name is Dmitrijs Kass, I am the data science team leader at Creamfinance, a company with data-driven decisions at the core of its values. I am passionate about data science, enjoy sharing my practical experience and explaining complex concepts in simple ways that aid understanding and long-term retention of ideas. Therefore, I am a regular instructor for data analysis with R programming language at the Physics, Mathematics and Optometry faculty of Latvian University and, recently, at Riga Business School. I have also battle-tested the course on data analysis and visualization with R on 150+ business representatives and earned <a href="#testimonials">honourable reviews</a>.</p>

<div id="why_r" class="section level3">
<h3>Why R?</h3>
<p>R is a free open-source programming language and an environment that, along with Python, has become an industry standard for data science and machine learning. R and RStudio together offer great tools for a broad range of business and academic needs: from exploratory data analysis, reproducible research, statistics, machine learning, automated data processing and web scraping to building interactive reports and web applications.</p>
