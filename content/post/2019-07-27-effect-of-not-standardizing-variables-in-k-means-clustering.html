<p>The process of clustering usually involves variable standardization. This post illustrates the effect of this important data pre-processing step on the result of k-means clustering with <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a> using a small data set of groceries shopping.</p>

<h1>Clustering, distances, k-means</h1>
<p>Clustering refers to a very broad set of techniques for finding subgroups, or clusters, in a data set. When we cluster the observations of a data set, we seek to partition them into distinct groups so that</p>
<ul>
<li>the observations within each group are quite “similar” to each other,</li>
<li>while observations in different groups are quite “different” from each other.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many possible ways to define the concept of “(dis)similarity”, but by far the most common choice involves squared Euclidean distance <span class="citation">(James et al. 2017, 385–87)</span>.</p>
<p>The Euclidean distance of two points <span class="math inline">\((x_1, y_1)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\((x_2,y_2)\)</span> in a 2-dimensional space is calculated as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\sqrt{(x_2−x_1)^2+(y_2−y_1)^2}\text{.}\]</span>
For example, if we are given two points with coordinates (1, 2) and (4, 6) then the Euclidean distance <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> between these points is 5:</p>

<p>Let’s take k-means clustering. The algorithm aims to partition observations into <em>k</em> groups such that the sum of squared <em>distances</em> from observations to the assigned cluster centers is minimized. In the example plotted below, there are two distinct clusters (<span class="math inline">\(k=2\)</span>) with 10 observations in each. Cluster centers are highlighted with colored crosses.</p>

<h1>Surprise</h1>
<p>Imagine you have a purchasing history of customers in a local shop. You would like to cluster them into groups with similar purchasing habits to target them later with different offers and marketing materials. For simplicity, you pick only four customers and their history of purchasing caviar and bread during the last month. Purchases of both products are measured in kilograms (data available <a href="/post/2019-07-27-effect-of-not-standardizing-variables-in-k-means-clustering_files/groceries.csv">here</a>):</p>

<p>The plot below depicts four selected customers in two dimensions: weight of caviar and bread purchased during the last month. Please do a mental exercise and assign these four customers into two clusters.</p>
<p><img src="/post/2019-07-27-effect-of-not-standardizing-variables-in-k-means-clustering_files/figure-html/plot_surprise_1_question-1.png" width="576" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Ready?</p>
<p>Did you assign Anthony with Barbara into one cluster and Cynthia with David into another? That’s not what k-means would do without standardizing the variables.</p>
</div>
<div id="original-variables" class="section level1">
<h1>Original variables</h1>
<p>Let’s check by performing k-means with <span class="math inline">\(k=2\)</span>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Data for clustering.
groceries_num &lt;- groceries_df[-1]
# Reproducibility.
set.seed(1)
# K-means with original variables.
kmeans_orig &lt;- kmeans(groceries_num, centers = 2)</code></pre>
<p>The result is plotted below with David being alone in cluster 2 and all other customers in cluster 1. Hopefully, you are surprised.</p>
<p><img src="/post/2019-07-27-effect-of-not-standardizing-variables-in-k-means-clustering_files/figure-html/plot_kmeans_orig-1.png" width="576" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>The catch is in the visualization - notice that x and y axes have different scales. The length of one unit on the x axis (i.e. 1 kilo of caviar) is exactly 20 times shorter than the length of one unit on the y axis (i.e. 1 kilo of bread). As a result, diagonal distances are hard to evaluate visually. It seems that Cynthia is closer to David than to Barbara. But it’s an illusion. Note the distances on the plot below:</p>
<p><img src="/post/2019-07-27-effect-of-not-standardizing-variables-in-k-means-clustering_files/figure-html/plot_kmeans_orig_with_dist-1.png" width="576" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>All pairwise Euclidean distances can be calculated with <code>dist()</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Add rownames to see customer names in a distance matrix.
groceries_num &lt;- as.data.frame(groceries_num)
rownames(groceries_num) &lt;- groceries_df$customer
# Euclidean distances.
round(dist(groceries_num), 1)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##         Anthony Barbara Cynthia
## Barbara     1.0                
## Cynthia     2.7     1.7        
## David       5.6     4.6     3.0</code></pre>
<p>If we re-plot the same data set while ensuring that one unit on the x-axis (i.e. 1 kilo of caviar) has the same length as one unit on the y-axis (i.e. 1 kilo of bread), the k-means result is no longer a surprise:</p>
<p><img src="/post/2019-07-27-effect-of-not-standardizing-variables-in-k-means-clustering_files/figure-html/plot_kmeans_orig_coord_equal-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Now this clustering may look correct. However, acknowledge that caviar is a delicacy. In comparison with bread, it is consumed in considerably smaller amounts and it is priced considerably higher. Therefore, for the purpose of customer segmentation, a difference of 1 kilo of caviar is more important than 1 kilo of bread. A calculation of distances using original, or non-standardized, variables does not differentiate between caviar and bread, essentially assuming these two products are identical. <strong>To summarize, a higher variation in a variable with bread weights has a higher impact on the Euclidean distance calculations and, as a result, on clustering results.</strong></p>
<p>So the results of clustering depend on the variation of variables in the data set. We can resolve this problem by standardizing the data prior to the clustering.</p>
</div>
<div id="standardized-variables" class="section level1">
<h1>Standardized variables</h1>
<p>Different standardization methods are available, including z-standardization (also called z-score standardization) and range standardization. Z-standardization rescales each variable <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> by subtracting its mean <span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}\)</span> and dividing by its standard deviation <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Z=\frac{X-\bar{x}}{s}.\]</span></p>
<p>After z-standardization each variable has a mean <span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}\)</span> of 0 and a standard deviation <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> of 1. Z-standardization can be done with <code>scale()</code>.</p>
<p>In cluster analysis, however, range standardization (e.g., to a range of 0 to 1) typically works better <span class="citation">(Milligan and Cooper 1988)</span>. Range standardization requires subtracting the minimum value and then dividing it by the range (i.e., the difference between the maximum and minimum value):</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[R = \frac{X - X_{min}}{X_{max} - X_{min}}\]</span></p>
<p>We can write a one-line function to perform range standardization:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>standardize_range &lt;- function(x) {(x - min(x)) / (max(x) - min(x))}</code></pre>
<p>Then apply our new function to each column:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>groceries_num_scaled &lt;- apply(groceries_num, 
                              MARGIN = 2, 
                              FUN = standardize_range)
groceries_num_scaled</code></pre>
<pre><code>##          caviar_kg  bread_kg
## Anthony 0.00000000 1.0000000
## Barbara 0.09090909 0.8181818
## Cynthia 0.90909091 0.5454545
## David   1.00000000 0.0000000</code></pre>
<p>Notice that each column now has a range of one.</p>
<p>Repeat k-means clustering using <em>standardized</em> variables:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>set.seed(1)
kmeans_scaled &lt;- kmeans(groceries_num_scaled, centers = 2)</code></pre>
<p>The results have changed: Anthony and Barbara are now in cluster 1 and Cynthia and David are in cluster 2.</p>

<h1>Results</h1>
<p>Below is the side-by-side illustration of the effect of variable standardization on k-means clustering. Clustering plotted on the left uses original variables and does not differentiate between a kilo of caviar from a kilo of bread. Clustering plotted on the right uses standardized variables and takes into account the fact that caviar is a delicacy purchased in considerably smaller volumes than bread.</p>

</div>
<div id="conclusions" class="section level1">
<h1>Conclusions</h1>
<p>Perform exploratory data analysis prior to clustering and beware of the differences in variation of variables. Variables with higher variation tend to have a higher impact on clustering. There is no single right method of standardization. <span class="citation">(James et al. 2017, 400)</span> suggest trying several different choices and looking for the one with the most useful or interpretable solution. <span class="citation">(Milligan and Cooper 1988)</span> show that the range standardization typically works better for hierarchical clustering and that z-standardization may even be significantly worse than no standardization in the presence of outliers. In case of outliers a possible alternative is to use the median absolute deviation instead of the standard deviation <span class="citation">(Spector 2011, 160)</span>.</p>
