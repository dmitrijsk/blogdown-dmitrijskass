R is a free open-source programming language and an environment that, along with Python, became an industry standard for data science and machine learning. R and RStudio together offer great tools for a broad range of business and academic needs: from exploratory data analysis, reproducible research, statistics, machine learning, automated data processing and web scraping to building interactive reports and web applications. 

# Data analysis and visualization with R{#r_name}

This is an in-person 3-day workshop in data analysis and visualization with R. It covers all steps of a typical data science project except for modelling, i.e. about 70-80% of the work:


```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Typical steps in a data science project as in \"R for Data Science\" by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham [here](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html)"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/data_science_project_steps.png")
```

Modelling is mentioned only briefly to show how it fits into the steps covered. The content is battle-tested on 150+ participants. It is targeted at new R users and those, whose experience in R is fragmented. The language of instruction is English, Latvian or Russian. The length and content may be modified depending on your needs. Prior experience in programming is an advantage, but not required. Often workshop participants are experienced Excel users, willing to benefit from opportunities offered by a programming language, or users of other statistical software, such as SPSS and Stata.

### Learning outcomes{#r_outcomes}

After a 3-day workshop you will feel comfortable using R and RStudio in doing the following:

* data import from files and SQL databases,
* data export, 
* tidying data, 
* exploratory data analysis and visualization, 
* manipulating and joining large data sets,
* automating data analysis,
* generating reports with code, results and narrative to communicating the results of your work.

This is a solid foundation for applying R at work and continuing learning R independently.
