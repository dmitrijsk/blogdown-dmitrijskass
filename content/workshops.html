<p>R is a free open-source programming language and an environment that, along with Python, became an industry standard for data science and machine learning. R and RStudio together offer great tools for a broad range of business and academic needs: from exploratory data analysis, reproducible research, statistics, machine learning, automated data processing and web scraping to building interactive reports and web applications.</p>

<h1>Data analysis and visualization with R</h1>
<p>This is an in-person 3-day workshop in data analysis and visualization with R. It covers all steps of a typical data science project except for modelling, i.e. about 70-80% of the work:</p>

<p>Modelling is mentioned only briefly to show how it fits into the steps covered. The content is battle-tested on 150+ participants. It is targeted at new R users and those, whose experience in R is fragmented. The language of instruction is English, Latvian or Russian. The length and content may be modified depending on your needs. Prior experience in programming is an advantage, but not required. Often workshop participants are experienced Excel users, willing to benefit from opportunities offered by a programming language, or users of other statistical software, such as SPSS and Stata.</p>

<h3>Learning outcomes</h3>
<p>After a 3-day workshop you will feel comfortable using R and RStudio in doing the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>data import from files and SQL databases,</li>
<li>data export,</li>
<li>tidying data,</li>
<li>exploratory data analysis and visualization,</li>
<li>manipulating and joining large data sets,</li>
<li>automating data analysis,</li>
<li>generating reports with code, results and narrative to communicating the results of your work.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a solid foundation for applying R at work and continuing learning R independently.</p>

<h3>References from previous workshops</h3>
<p>“<em>Many thanks to Dmitrijs for a perfect course in 3 days. The content is well-thought-through and oriented to results. In 3 days gained clarity on a practical level about what can be done with R – from data processing to visualization. Recommend.</em>”, Sandijs Liepiņš, SIA Mintos.</p>
<p>“<em>Very organized and patient instructor. Replies to absolutely all questions. Takes into account the interests of the audience.</em>”, Elīna Tilta-Gerika, AAS SEB Life Insurance.</p>
<p>“<em>This course is valuable both for those who would like to learn about opportunities that R offers and for those who have learn R on their own. Course material is very well structured with a focus on practical applications. After the course you will be able to put new knowledge straight into the practice.</em>”, Anonymous.</p>
<p>“<em>Very valuable course and excellent presentation by the instructor.</em>”, Dita, Central Statistical Bureau of Latvia.</p>
<p>“<em>I definitely recommend this course to everyone who is new to R and also those who already use R but are not confident in their knowledge. The content is high quality, well structured and easy to understand! I would apply if there was a continuation of this course, thank you! :)</em>”, Sintija</p>
